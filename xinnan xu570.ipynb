    "# Introduction\n",
    "The real estate industry is one of the major sectors in the economies of every country, this is so because shelter is always a basic human need. However, housing prices fluctuate on a daily basis and are sometimes inflated rather than based on valuation. Our study project's major focus is on predicting house values using real-world factors. Here, we intend to base our assessments on each and every basic criterion that is taken into account when calculating the pricing.Price is a major concern for both entrepreneurs and the proposed clients it is the major determinant of whether an entrepreneur will acquire the asset or the client will settle to stay in a particular house or not. In this study, therefore, we'll build an algorithm to predict the prices of house based on different determinants\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been studies concerning the topic, according to (N.Miller et al), there seems to be a consensus among economists and policy makers that house prices play an important role in fueling the growth or decline of the economy. For\n",
    "instance, the strong housing market during the crash of the stock market in 2001 might have helped save the US economy from a more serious recession,and recent cooling of the housing market has triggered a recession since December 2007.An ostensible channel through which house prices might affect the economy is the wealth effect. Friedman’s permanent income hypothesis suggests that people would change their desired consumption if house price changes affect their expected life time wealth Recently, economists propose a collateral effect of house prices: houseprice increases help relax homeowners’borrowing constraints and increase their actual consumption since housing wealth is easy to collateralize."

    "## Data\n",
    "The data used for this analysis was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata. The dataset has a record of the different house prices, the number of rooms, the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, the size of the house in square feet and many other features related to housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building the predictive model, it would be necessary to remove some variables which are not relevant for our model, in this case we are to predict house price with regards to the following features ;\n",
    "* Price\n",
    "* Number of bedrooms\n",
    "* Number of bathrooms\n",
    "* Size of living room in square feet\n",
    "* Size of the lot\n",
    "* House Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we now know the all the variables we want to work with, we'll remove some of the variables so we remain with a simple dataframe."

Linear regression is a machine learning algorithm that is used for prediction and forecasting, in addition, linear regression shows the impact an independent variable has on dependent variable. Independent variable also known as predictor variables are the variables that explain or predict the outcome of a dependent variable, on the other hand, a dependent variable is the variable we want to predict.\n",

However, these impacts vary, some have positive impact, that is as their value increases the price of the house also tend to increase as in the case of the number of bathrooms, size of the living room, and the condition of the house, also, some features have an inverse relationship with the house as in the case of the number of bedrooms and the lot size.\n",

In the first model we included all the features and in the second mode we dropped some (sqft_lot, was dropped in model 2). To asses which model is a perfect fit for making the predictions, we determined their R-square values, the first model had a value of 50.3% while the second one had a value 0f 50.7%. Therefore, for making predictions we would prefer the second odel to the first model."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Using linear regression we can model the relationship between a dependent varible and independent variable(s). In order to predict a continous outcome such as the price of a house, linear regression is applicable. In the analysis to determine the price of houses, we have evaluated that in deed there is an association between the price of a house with some of its features suchh as the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, the condition of the house and even the size in square feet. However, in future we'd like to know how these features relate to the house condition, this might call for a different approach such as logistic regression since it is expected that the new dependent variable which would be the house condition would be a binary outcome, therefore, linear regression won't be applicable in this case as it only predicts continous outcomes."
